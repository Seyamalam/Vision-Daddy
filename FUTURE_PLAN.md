# Vision DADDY: Future Plans for Accessibility & Blind User Experience

This document outlines potential enhancements to make Vision DADDY more accessible and empowering for blind and visually impaired users.

---

## 1. Audio Feedback & Interaction

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):**
  - Automatically read image descriptions aloud.
  - Allow adjustment of speech rate, pitch, and volume.
- **Voice Commands:**
  - Enable control via voice (e.g., "capture image," "repeat description," "next," "previous").
- **Audio Cues:**
  - Play distinct sounds for events (e.g., capture success, error, new description).

---

## 2. Haptic Feedback

- **Vibration Alerts:**
  - Provide haptic feedback for key events (e.g., image captured, error, new description) on mobile or wearable devices.

---

## 3. Contextual & Richer Descriptions

- **Scene Summarization:**
  - Offer not just object lists, but contextual scene summaries.
- **Object Detection & Localization:**
  - Indicate where objects are in the scene (e.g., "A chair is to your left, a door is ahead.").
- **Actionable Information:**
  - Highlight important or actionable items (e.g., "There is a person waving at you.").

---

## 4. Navigation & Orientation

- **Directional Guidance:**
  - Provide spatial guidance (e.g., "Turn slightly right to face the door.").
- **Integration with GPS:**
  - Combine with location data for outdoor navigation cues.

---

## 5. History & Recall

- **Memory Bank:**
  - Allow users to ask, "What did I see 5 minutes ago?" or "Describe the last three images."
- **Searchable Descriptions:**
  - Enable search/filter of past descriptions by keyword or time.

---

## 6. Real-Time Assistance

- **Live Assistance Mode:**
  - Send live images or stream to a trusted contact for real-time help.
- **Emergency Alerts:**
  - Detect dangerous situations and alert the user or a caregiver.

---

## 7. Customization & Personalization

- **User Preferences:**
  - Let users choose detail level, language, or info types to emphasize.
- **Profile Learning:**
  - System learns user preferences over time.

---

## 8. Accessibility Best Practices

- **Simple, Consistent UI:**
  - Ensure screen-reader friendliness, large buttons, and clear navigation.
- **Offline Mode:**
  - Cache recent descriptions and allow basic functionality without internet.

---

## 9. Integration with Other Assistive Tech

- **Smart Glasses or Wearables:**
  - Integrate with devices for direct audio/haptic feedback.
- **Smart Home Integration:**
  - Announce descriptions or alerts through smart speakers.

---

## 10. Privacy & Security

- **User Control:**
  - Let users control what is shared, stored, or sent to the cloud.
- **Data Encryption:**
  - Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
